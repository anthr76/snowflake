# Observability Integration Summary

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully integrated advanced log parsing from `router-observability.nix` into the main `router.nix` module, providing comprehensive observability for both routers and servers.

### Key Features Added to Router Module

1. **Advanced Log Parsing**:
   - **DHCP logs**: Parses DHCP lease events (DISCOVER, OFFER, REQUEST, ACK, NAK, RELEASE) with client MAC and IP extraction
   - **DNS logs**: Parses DNS queries with client IP, query name, and record type extraction
   - **BGP logs**: Parses BGP neighbor state changes when FRR is enabled

2. **Router-Specific Exporters**:
   - **Node exporter**: Always enabled for system metrics
   - **BIND exporter**: Enabled when DNS/VLANs are configured
   - **FRR exporter**: Enabled when BGP is configured

3. **Vector Labels**: Automatic addition of router-specific labels (role, domain, interfaces, site)

### Configuration Changes

- **`modules/nixos/router.nix`**: Added comprehensive observability configuration with advanced log parsing
- **Removed**: `modules/nixos/router-observability.nix` (functionality integrated into main router module)
- **Priority Handling**: Used `mkForce` to ensure router settings override server personality defaults

### Build Validation

- ✅ `fw1-nwk3` router configuration builds successfully
- ✅ `bkp1` server configuration builds successfully
- ✅ Vector transforms validated and working
- ✅ No configuration conflicts between server and router personalities

### Vector Configuration Highlights

The integrated Vector configuration processes logs through conditional logic within remap transforms:
- Filters logs by systemd unit (`_SYSTEMD_UNIT`)
- Extracts meaningful fields using regex parsing
- Adds service-type labels for better categorization
- Maintains compatibility with Grafana Cloud Loki ingestion

This approach provides rich, structured logs for both operational monitoring and troubleshooting network infrastructure.
